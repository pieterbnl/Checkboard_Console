// Part 1. Make a simple console app. Make it say what you want.
Console.WriteLine("**********************");
Console.WriteLine("Draw me a checkerboard");
Console.WriteLine("**********************");

// Part 2. Make it accept user input and have it print out something based on that input.
Console.WriteLine("Before we start. What's your name?");


/*Part 3: Make a checkerboard in the console, using nested for loops.
As addition:
- allow the user to select the characters for the checkerboard
- allow the user input the number of rows and columns
- add a coloring scheme to the output
- check for (in)valid input*/

/*BONUS:
- implement a selection menu
- refacture your code, taking in account SOLID principles*/
